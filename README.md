# SOC Lab Troubleshooting

## Overview
This repository contains documented troubleshooting and incident-style issues encountered while building and operating a SOC home lab.

Each issue represents a real failure scenario, including the symptoms observed, root cause analysis, resolution steps, and security-relevant lessons learned.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical problem-solving, infrastructure awareness, and SOC-oriented thinking rather than just successful lab outcomes.

## Repository Structure
Each folder in this repository documents a single issue:

- One issue per folder
- Clear problem description
- Investigation and root cause analysis
- Resolution and validation
- SOC relevance and lessons learned

This structure mirrors real-world incident documentation and operational troubleshooting workflows.

## Why This Matters for SOC Analysts
Security operations frequently deal with systems that are partially broken, misconfigured, or behaving unexpectedly. Understanding how and why infrastructure fails is essential for:

- Incident investigation
- Threat detection and response
- Maintaining security visibility
- Ensuring availability of logging and monitoring systems

This repository highlights hands-on experience with diagnosing and resolving such issues in a controlled lab environment.

## Scope
- Active Directory and Windows Server issues
- DNS and network-related problems
- Logging and visibility failures
- Security tooling misconfigurations

Additional issues will be added as the lab evolves.

## Disclaimer
This repository is for learning and documentation purposes only and reflects a controlled lab environment.
